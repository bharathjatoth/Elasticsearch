# Elasticsearch
This will go through how to use elasticsearch and how it scales up to the products with large amount of data

Recently Chrome has disabled the extension sense which is excellent for elastic search. We have kibana which replace the sense extension and visualize all the data in real time which is highly efficient

In the above files I was going through how to install the elasticsearch along with Kiabana and activate it.

First get the Elastic search from the following link 
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch

Then migrate to the folder and unzip it and go to /bin/elasticsearch.in to start the elasticsearch. The port number will be displayed on the terminal.
